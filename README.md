# Google-TicTacToe-AI-BOT
I tried making an AI which detects X and O from the screen using OpenCV2 in the game "play tic tac toe" ( A google made game ), and used those coordinates to eliminate the no. of chances the bot can have and thus only be able to put X or O in the remaining unused box. Also the bot can randomly choose between X or O at the start of every game.
